# DeepOCL

This repository contains code and corpus for the CAAI Transactions on Intelligence Technology 2023 paper [DeepOCL: A deep natural network for Object Constraint Language generation from unrestricted nature language](http://doi.org/10.1049/cit2.12207).

Currently OCLPairs is available, the setence-level aligned corpus for NL-OCL.
